'''
Inputs:
- short_desc (string describing the document)
- target_audience (string describing who the document is for)
- severity_level (string describing sensitivity)
- departments (list containing exactly ONE department)

Outputs:
- content (AI‑generated document content)
- header (AI‑generated header)
- filename (AI‑generated filename)
- department (the single department passed in)

Notes:
- This version removes all input() calls.
- All values are now passed in as parameters.
- Departments are no longer hardcoded; caller must pass exactly ONE department.
- All original logic and intent preserved.
